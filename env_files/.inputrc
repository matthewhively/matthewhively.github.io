# GNU Readline:
# A set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.
# (more than just BASH)

## arrow up
"\e[A":history-search-backward
## arrow down
"\e[B":history-search-forward

# TODO: get these stupid commands to work instead
#"\e[A":history-substr-search-backward
#"\e[A":history-substring-search-up

#"\e[B":history-substr-search-forward
#"\e[B":history-substring-search-down

# NOTE: these commands may require additional installations GNU readline? install from homebrew using these steps: http://blogs.perl.org/users/aristotle/2013/07/easy-osx-termreadlinegnu.html
#      Also need to have installed cpan before hand (type "cpan" to begin)
#      And then install cpanm (sudo cpan App::cpanminus)
